Player Management System
Overview
Welcome to the Player Management System! üèè This is a console-based application built in C that allows users to manage sports player data. The system provides functionalities to add, update, search, remove, and sort player data efficiently.

Whether you are managing cricket players or any other sport, this system simplifies handling player statistics like runs, wickets, and matches played. With an easy-to-use, menu-driven interface, this program demonstrates core programming concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, structs, and sorting algorithms.

Features
* Add Players: Dynamically add new player data (jersey number, name, runs, wickets, matches played).
* Search Players: Search for players by jersey number or name.
* Update Player Information: Modify stats like runs, wickets, and matches played.
* Sort Players: Sort players based on runs or wickets to analyze performance.
* Remove Players: Remove a player from the system by jersey number.
* User-Friendly Interface: Interactive menu options for easy navigation.
Project Structure
This project is structured into separate functions for each functionality, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

Main Features:
1. Add Player: Dynamically allocates memory to add multiple players.
2. Display Players: Displays a list of all players with their stats.
3. Search Player: Searches by jersey number or name.
4. Update Player: Allows modification of a player‚Äôs runs, wickets, or matches played.
5. Sort Players: Sorts the players by runs or wickets in descending order.
6. Remove Player: Removes a player from the system.
7. Exit Option: Safely exits the program.

How It Works
1. Adding Players: When you choose to add a player, the program will prompt you to enter the player‚Äôs details like jersey number, name, runs, wickets, and matches played. This information is stored in a dynamic array.

2. Searching for Players: You can search for a player either by their jersey number or name. If found, the program will display their complete stats.

3. Updating Player Information: You can update a player‚Äôs stats such as runs, wickets, or matches played.

4. Sorting Players: You can sort players based on their runs or wickets in descending order to see the best performers.

5. Removing Players: Players can be removed from the list by their jersey number. The remaining players‚Äô data is re-arranged accordingly.

Technologies Used:
* Programming Language: C
* Key Concepts:
- Dynamic memory management using malloc and realloc.
- Sorting algorithms for sorting player data.
- Modular approach with separate functions for each operation.
